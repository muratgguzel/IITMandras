In addition to inheritance, there is of course a need for composition of various contracts (classes) to write extensible and clean contracts.\n","\n","You can go through the following contract and deploy it to see the behaviour. A few relevant points:\n","\n","1. ```Users``` contract creates a dynamic list/array of ```User``` contracts by doing the following:\n","\n","  - ```User[] private _userList;```\n","\n","  As you can see, you can use contracts, similar to built-in data types, while adding in arrays, mappings, structs, etc.\n","\n","2. To create a new ```User``` instance from the ```Users``` contract, you can use the ```new``` keyword while providing the appropriate arguments as per the constructor:\n","\n","  - ```User newUser = new User(_user_address, _email, _username, _country, _role);```\n","\n","3. You'll also notice examples of manipulating the array:\n","\n","  - Adding an element to the array using ```push```: ```_userList.push(newUser);```\n","  - Querying the length of array using ```.length```: ```_userList.length```\n","  - Fetching a specific element of the array: ```_userList[_index]```\n","\n","4. Referring to types created in another contract:\n","\n","  - ```User.UserRole```\n","  - ```User.UserData```\n","\n","5. You can return a complex type from a function. This would show up as a tuple of the in-built elements when you deploy and call. This is quite useful while trying to return multiple elements without having to specify them one-by-one in the returns section.\n","  - ```function getUser(uint _index) public view returns (User.UserData memory)```\n","\n","6. For any complex data type, you'll have to specify the ```memory``` keyword in specific situations. This is to ensure that Solidity (and the EVM) won't try to map them to state variables and store them on the blockchain, when it's not needed.\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\n","\n","pragma solidity 0.8.6;\n","\n","\n","contract User {\n","    enum UserRole {ADMIN, NORMAL}\n","    \n","    struct UserData {\n","        address user_address;\n","        string email;\n","        string username;\n","        string country;\n","        UserRole role;\n","    }\n","    \n","    UserData private _userdata;\n","    \n","    constructor(address _user_address, string memory _email, string memory _username, string memory _country, UserRole _role) {\n","        _userdata.user_address = _user_address;\n","        _userdata.email = _email;\n","        _userdata.username = _username;\n","        _userdata.country = _country;\n","        _userdata.role = _role;\n","    }\n","    \n","    function getUserData() public view returns (UserData memory) {\n","        return _userdata;\n","    }\n","    \n","    function changeUserRole(UserRole _newRole) public {\n","        _userdata.role = _newRole;\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","\n","contract Users {\n","    User[] private _userList;\n","    \n","    function addUser(address _user_address, string memory _email, string memory _username, string memory _country, User.UserRole _role) public returns (uint){\n","        User newUser = new User(_user_address, _email, _username, _country, _role);\n","        _userList.push(newUser);\n","        return _userList.length - 1;\n","    }\n","    \n","    function getUser(uint _index) public view returns (User.UserData memory) {\n","        require(_userList.length > _index, \"Index out of range\");\n","        User foundUser = _userList[_index];\n","        return foundUser.getUserData();\n","    }\n","    \n","    function changeUserRole(uint _index, User.UserRole _role) public {\n","        require(_userList.length > _index, \"Index out of range\");\n","        User foundUser = _userList[_index];\n","        foundUser.changeUserRole(_role);\n","    }\n","    \n","    \n","}\n","\n","\n","```\n","\n"]}]}
